How to Run the Age Calculator
Prerequisites
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. If you don't have one, you can get GCC (for Linux and macOS) or Dev (for Windows).

Steps
Download the Code

Click on the green "Code" button on the repository page and choose "Download ZIP".
Extract the ZIP file to your preferred location.
Navigate to the Code Directory

Open your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows).
Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you've extracted the code.

cd path/to/directory

Compile the Code

On the terminal, enter the following command: g++ Age-Calculator.cpp -o Age-Calculator

This will compile the Age-Calculator.cpp file and create an executable named Age-Calculator (or Age-Calculator.exe on Windows).

After compiling, you can run the program with the following command: ./Age-Calculator
On Windows, use: Age-Calculator.exe

Now, follow any on-screen instructions provided by the program to calculate age.
